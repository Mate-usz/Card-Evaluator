# Card-Evaluator

This program searches the value of a card by making a request to the respective websites.

## How it works

At the moment it works with Yu-Gi-Oh cards, probably in future I'll add more trading cards.

### Example

Lets suppose that you want to know the price of a card

```
Blue eyes white dragon
```

You write it to a .txt file, then open it clicking the browse button in the program.
After that you choose where to display the result (Warning: Let the radio button at "Name" DON'T change it to "Card Code") and press the Search Button.
After a while it will show you the result!
